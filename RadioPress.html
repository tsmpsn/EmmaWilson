					REVIEW OF "LIVE & ACOUSTIC" BLUES MATTERS MAGAZINE
					EMMA WILSON
					LIVE AND ACOUSTIC
					Independent
					Emma is a Tees Side based vocalist of some note who will be familiar among festival and gig goers as she has fronted her own Emma Wilson Band and shared stages with many other top- level performers. On this mini album she gets to showcase the purity and range of her vocal prowess. This is just Emma with acoustic guitar provided by Al Harrington, joined on two tracks by additional guitarist Paul Donnelly. Four of the five tracks are well chosen covers but for me the original opener Wish Her Well is the stand out. It’s a well written song about lost love but with a slight twist that sets it apart and Emma delivers the vocal beautifully, her voice has a sweetness and clarity and unlike many singers out there, her diction is tremendous. Next up is I’m Gonna Tear Your Playhouse Down by Earl Randle. The version I&#96;m most familiar with is by Graham Parker but Emma puts her own stamp on it, showing great control on what is a difficult lyric to sing. Following this is the Screaming Jay Hawkins classic I Put A Spell On You. This version definitely takes the song to a different place, the slight menace of the original replaced and turning it into a plaintive love song. The final two tracks are more traditional blues numbers and with Paul joining the party the raunch level goes up a little. The old Roosevelt Sykes number, Night Time Is The Right Time finds Emma showing a bit more grit without losing any of the distinctiveness or clarity of her vocal, really opening up and hitting the ceiling on the outro. Emma continues in the same vane on her version of the Willie Dixon penned Hoochie Coochie Mama sounding load and proud. I hope the radio play this has garnered, especially for Wish Her Well encourages Emma to record more and to write more, there is gold waiting to be discovered and I’d love to hear an album of originals with a full electric band.

					1ST YORK BLUES FESTIVAL APRIL 2019 ( tom thres also a photo of the article)
					REVIEW : STEVE BANKS 
					Middlesbrough has been the home to some legendary Blues artists and the Emma Wilson Band is a strong contender to join them. Emma is heavily influenced by Ann Peebles and her opening number I’m Going To Tear Your Playhouse Down was a fine example of the soulful side of the blues. Chain Of Fools followed and then came Every Day I Have The Blues. Those two North East Blues classics Bring It On Home and (a funky version of) House Of The Rising Sun further demonstrated why Emma’s reputation is steadily growing. Slipped, Tripped and Fell in Love was a popular number with the audience, as was the duet with the talented guitarist Al Harrington. The last number, Mojo was a real crowd pleaser and would prove to be a very hard number to follow.
